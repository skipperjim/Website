Project template project for [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon)

Based on Luke Wilde's [phaser-js-boilerplate](https://github.com/lukewilde/phaser-js-boilerplate). Please refer to the project for more information.

I've removed the `.jshintrc` so you can choose your own linting settings.

Constants moved from `BasicGame` to `properties.js`.

**Note for older versions of the book (pre-October 2014):**

You should use an older version of this template if you're using an older version of the book (i.e. one that does not specify the Phaser version in the Introduction).

Get the older version via:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bryanbibat/html5shmup-template.git
    $ git checkout js-2.0-final
